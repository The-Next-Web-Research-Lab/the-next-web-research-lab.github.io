Three things are needed. Readability, readability, readability. Perhaps readability is more important for test code than for actual code. To improve readability in test code, as with any code, clarity, simplicity, and rich expressiveness are needed. Test code should express a lot with minimal expression.</p><p>Using the convention of given-when-then makes the test code easier to read. But unfortunately, separating the tests creates a lot of duplicate code. So the best rule is &quot;minimize the number of assert statements per concept&quot; and &quot;test only one concept per test function&quot;.</p><h4 id="f-i-r-s-t" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#f-i-r-s-t" aria-hidden="true">#</a> F.I.R.S.T.</h4><ul><li>Fast: Tests should be fast.</li><li>Independent: Each test should not depend on each other.</li><li>Repeatable: Tests should be repeatable in any environment.</li><li>Self-Validating: Tests are either success or failure.</li><li>Timely: Tests should be written in a timely manner.</li></ul>',25),r=[a];function o(l,d){return i(),t("div",null,r)}const p=e(s,[["render",o],["__file","18.html.vue"]]);export{p as default};
