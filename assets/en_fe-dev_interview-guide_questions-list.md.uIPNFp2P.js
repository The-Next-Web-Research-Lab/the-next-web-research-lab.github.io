We need to exchange knowledge and information about software development, and we need to discuss technologies, tools, and methodologies.</li><li>What are our core values? What are the main skills we need? What are the things you want to do better, do you want to get better? Before you hire a new person, you need to prepare your own answers to these questions.</li></ol></blockquote><h2 id="why-should-i-prepare-questions" tabindex="-1">Why should I prepare questions? <a class="header-anchor" href="#why-should-i-prepare-questions" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Why should I prepare questions?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>An interview is the process of finding a colleague to work with. The interviewer should determine if the candidate is the person we need, whether he or she is a good person to work with, and whether he or she is a good person to work with.</p><p>However, I&#39;ve seen many cases where the interviewer failed to ask the applicant a few questions or failed to evaluate the applicant because he was focused on the question.</p><p>Considering the applicant&#39;s time and effort to support our company, the interviewer also needs to be prepared at a minimum. Preparing interview questions will allow you to focus your assessment of the candidate and allow for rich conversations during the interview.</p><h2 id="when-should-i-prepare-my-questions" tabindex="-1">When should I prepare my questions? <a class="header-anchor" href="#when-should-i-prepare-my-questions" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;When should I prepare my questions?&quot;">​</a></h2><p>If you don&#39;t have much experience as an interviewer, you need to prepare a day in advance. This is because you need to prepare a list of questions by looking at the applicant&#39;s cover letter and project history, and if you have a tech stack that you have never done before, you need to prepare questions after basic learning.</p><p>If you have a lot of experience as an interviewer, it is enough to prepare 30~60 minutes in advance. This is because at this time, it is easy to look at your resume and come up with a list of questions. And in many cases, we already know about the tech stack.</p><h2 id="how-to-create-a-list-of-questions" tabindex="-1">How to create a list of questions <a class="header-anchor" href="#how-to-create-a-list-of-questions" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;How to create a list of questions&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The list of questions should be prepared by looking at the cover letter and performance history on the resume. Write it in a place where you can write text, such as a notepad or Word, and use a list of questions during the interview.</p><p>Here&#39;s an example of a list of questions I wrote while preparing for an interview:</p><div class="language- vp-adaptive-theme"><button title="Copy Code" class="copy"></button><span class="lang"></span><pre class="shiki shiki-themes github-light github-dark vp-code"><code><span class="line"><span># Self-introduction</span></span>
