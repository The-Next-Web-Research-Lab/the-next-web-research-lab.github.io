Knowing the deployment point makes it easy to solve service failures and to understand the dependencies of the software. Depending on the project, I recorded the version in two ways, and I want to share the experience.</p><h2 id="use-date-as-version" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#use-date-as-version" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Use date as version</h2><p>When I was in charge of the Kakao movie reservation service, which is now closed, I used the date as the version. I used the <code>YYYYMMDD</code> format, for example, 20230101, which means filling in the year, month, and day.</p><p>This method makes it easy to know when it was deployed. It is useful when you want to know the point because failures can occur depending on the deployment point.</p><p>The service is deployed to multiple server devices, and sometimes there are cases where deployment is not done to a specific server device due to a deployment issue. In this case, I was able to check the version through a failure monitoring tool like Sentry and find out if there was anything that was not deployed by looking through the server device.</p><h2 id="use-semantic-version" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#use-semantic-version" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Use semantic version</h2><p>Semantic version was used when I operated the internal library at the time of Kakao&#39;s internal platform development.</p><p>This method is a good way to express the state of the software. Generally, the <code>[major].[minor].[patch]</code> format is used. For example, 1.2.3, which means writing with dots.</p><p>Each version is raised for the following reasons:</p><ul><li>major: when the function changes incompatibly with the existing version</li><li>minor: when a new function is added while being compatible with the existing version</li><li>patch: when a bug is fixed while being compatible with the existing version</li></ul>',11),l={href:"https://semver.org/lang/en/",target:"_blank",rel:"noopener noreferrer"};function p(m,f){const n=i("ExternalLinkIcon");return a(),s("div",null,[c,o("p",null,[e("For more information on semantic version, see "),o("a",l,[e("semver.org"),r(n)]),e(".")])])}const v=t(d,[["render",p],["__file","software-versioning.html.vue"]]);export{v as default};
