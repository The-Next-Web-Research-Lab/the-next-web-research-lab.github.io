Lighthouse is an open source web page quality improvement tool released by Google Chrome, and can be easily used in Chrome Developer Tools.</p><p>Lighthouse allows you to select your mobile device. Did you know that when you select a mobile device and measure its performance, not only the screen size but also CPU and network performance are adjusted?</p><p><img src="'+r+'" alt="lighthouse device"></p><p>This time, we will learn about understanding mobile devices in Lighthouse by comparing them to desktops in Lighthouse.</p><p>index</p><ul><li><ol><li>Device screen</li></ol></li><li><ol start="2"><li>Device performance</li></ol></li><li>Appendix) Reasons for differences from the measurement results in the Performance tab</li></ul><h2 id="_1-device-screen" tabindex="-1">1.

So no matter how much you adjust the browser size, the mobile screen does not change and always displays the same screen.</p><p>The desktop screen is displayed based on the screen currently being displayed. So, when you adjust the browser size, the desktop screen also changes.</p><h2 id="_2-device-performance" tabindex="-1">2.

To be exact, the delay time is set to a fixed value of 150ms, the download speed is 1.6Mbps, and the upload speed is 750Kbps.</p><p>The desktop uses the performance of the PC being measured.
