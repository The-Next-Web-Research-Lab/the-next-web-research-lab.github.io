Roughly implement/develop the markup

Sometimes, there is a design for the overall flow, but not for the detailed parts, right?
The detailed parts can be done later, so at this time, focus on the layout and the shape of the work.
Step 2. (Optional) Componentize the duplicated UI elements

Step 3. Define the DTO of the REST API

Step 4. Connect the mock data to the REST API flow

Have you ever tried to run the REST API after receiving a confirmation from the backend developer, but it didnâ€™t work?
You can proceed with the next task by connecting the mock data until it is fixed.
Step 5. Connect to the REST API server

Step 6. Connect the UI detail scenarios

Step 7. Refactor the duplicated logic
