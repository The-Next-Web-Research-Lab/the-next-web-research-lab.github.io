I&#39;m a planner and cautious person, so I get stressed out when something unexpected happens that I&#39;m not used to. And when information overload occurred, judgment would be clouded.</p><p><a href="https://www.mentalhealth.go.kr/portal/disease/diseaseDetail.do?dissId=30&amp;srCodeNm=%EC%8A%A4%ED%8A%B8%EB%A0%88%EC%8A%A4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Stress at the Centers for Disease Control and Preventionis</a> is considered one of the mental illnesses. When people are stressed, their judgment is clouded, and they are unable to perform to their full potential. In other words, if you reduce the points of stress, your work efficiency will increase accordingly.</p><h2 id="reducing-stress" tabindex="-1">Reducing Stress <a class="header-anchor" href="#reducing-stress" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Reducing Stress&quot;">​</a></h2><h3 id="reduce-simple-repetitive-tasks" tabindex="-1">Reduce simple, repetitive tasks <a class="header-anchor" href="#reduce-simple-repetitive-tasks" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Reduce simple, repetitive tasks&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Simple, repetitive tasks are exhausting, so reducing them can help improve stress.

In this case, I solved it by writing a nodejs script that converts the image into an icon component. As long as you pay attention to nodejs&#39; file system, string changes, and where to execute commands, writing scripts is a simple solution. The code formatting of the generated icon component can be easily solved by running Prettier in nodejs.</p><p>Lastly, when defining the DTO type of the REST API, read the Swagger documentation to define the DTO type. <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/swagger-typescript-api" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">swagger-typescript-api</a> I was able to improve it by utilizing it.

At this time, the context of the work you were focusing on is broken, and when you come back, it takes time to recover.</p><p>As seniority in the company accumulated, roles and tasks increased, and context switching occurred frequently. That&#39;s why I&#39;ve always practiced the basics of engineering, which is to break down big things into smaller pieces.</p><p>When you do front-end development, you link markup and REST APIs, and then refactor after completion.
