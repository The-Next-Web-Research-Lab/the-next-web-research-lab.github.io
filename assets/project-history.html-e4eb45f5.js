At the beginning of the next year, the results were announced, and the salary improvement rate and the opportunity for the next promotion changed depending on the performance.</p><p>In my first year, I didn&#39;t know anything, so I wrote whatever came to mind when it was time to write it. I wanted to grow a little more, and I tried to keep track of my work every month and be specific, because with promotions and professional level upgrades, more roles will be given to me.</p><p>Not everything is affected by this, but by the time he was in his ninth year, he had two early promotions and upgraded his job level to senior. Now, I&#39;d like to share my experience.</p><h4 id="how-much-does-the-head-of-the-organization-know-about-me" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#how-much-does-the-head-of-the-organization-know-about-me" aria-hidden="true">#</a> How much does the head of the organization know about me?</h4><p>The head of the organization that evaluates my work performance didn&#39;t know exactly what I was good at, what I had achieved, and what kind of career I wanted to have. One of the roles of an organization leader is to manage people, but most of them are the most busy and busy at work. That&#39;s why it&#39;s hard to talk about work unless it&#39;s performance management season, a 1:1 meeting, or a check-in meeting.</p><p>Depending on the size of the company, as well as my evaluation authority, the head of the organization will appeal to the higher level of the organization leader for my performance or promotion and give other colleagues a valid reason. Therefore, in the season of appealing work performance, it is necessary to appeal numerically and specifically to the head of the organization.</p><h4 id="reuse-when-changing-jobs" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#reuse-when-changing-jobs" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Reuse when changing jobs</h4><p>Work history management is useful not only when appealing or promoting performance, but also when changing jobs. When you change jobs, you should write down the tasks you performed, and you should explain the tasks you performed during the interview. If you simply remember it in your head, it will be difficult to answer in the interview room, and if the answer is ambiguous, it will be difficult for the interviewers to verify it, so it will not be possible to know whether the work performed was done by this person.</p><h4 id="so-how-should-i-write-my-achievements" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#so-how-should-i-write-my-achievements" aria-hidden="true">#</a> So, how should I write my achievements?</h4><p>The more specific and numerical the performance, the better. The outcome is to write what effect the solution has in the real world. If you write it abstractly, you can only be abstract about what effect you have brought. If you write it in detail, you can also know the effect in detail.</p><p>The achievement can be well evaluated when the achievement is about 110 ~ 150% rather than 100%. 100% performance is actually just doing what the company tells you to do, and it&#39;s the reward you received for your salary. Exceeding 110 ~ 150% is more than what you have received with your own efforts.</p><p>In order to overachieve, it is good to do what you are instructed to do well, but it is also good to do additional work. It is also good to do dissemination training to spread the skills learned to internal employees, or to improve productivity or improve the performance of services.</p><h2 id="format" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#format" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Format</h2><p>When it comes to managing my work history, I use this format.</p><div class="language-text line-numbers-mode" data-ext="text"><pre class="language-text"><code>Project name
