It goes back 300 years to look at the lives and achievements of Leibniz, Boole, Frege, Cantor, Hilbert, Gödel, and Turing.</p><p>It also covers von Neumann and Turing, who laid the foundation for the universal computer. Von Neumann contributed to the ENIAC, which consisted of 18,000 vacuum tubes, and pursued a classical method of mathematical calculation that repeated complex calculations countless times. On the other hand, Turing contributed to the Colossus, which consisted of 1,500 vacuum tubes, and proposed a relatively simple machine, and left the rest of the functionality to be solved by software.</p>',10),n=[s];function l(c,h,d,u,m,p){return a(),t("div",null,n)}const b=e(r,[["render",l]]);export{_ as __pageData,b as default};
