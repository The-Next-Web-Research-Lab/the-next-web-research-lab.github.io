Three things are needed. Readability, readability, readability. Perhaps readability is more important for test code than for actual code. To improve readability in test code, as with any code, clarity, simplicity, and rich expressiveness are needed. Test code should express a lot with minimal expression.</p><p>Using the convention of given-when-then makes the test code easier to read.
