Depending on the situation, it acknowledges that choosing the right framework can greatly help reduce development time and succeed in the project. It also explains how to choose the &#39;appropriate&#39; framework according to systematic analysis and decision-making techniques.</p><h2 id="about-frameworks" tabindex="-1">About frameworks <a class="header-anchor" href="#about-frameworks" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;About frameworks&quot;">​</a></h2><h3 id="what-is-a-framework" tabindex="-1">What is a framework? <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-is-a-framework" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;What is a framework?&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The relationship between code, framework, and library</p><p><img src="'+r+'" alt="What is a framework?"></p><h3 id="technical-debt" tabindex="-1">Technical debt <a class="header-anchor" href="#technical-debt" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Technical debt&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Ward Cunningham introduced the concept of technical debt.
