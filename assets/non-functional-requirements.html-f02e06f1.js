Even if the software is perfectly designed in the document, the effort of writing the document and developing the software will not be recognized if the software does not work as intended.</p><p>To improve the <strong>quality of software</strong>, <strong>non-functional requirements must be met</strong>. Non-functional requirements have a great impact on development, maintenance, operation, and efficient use of computer resources. Most of the failures that occur during operation after deployment are due to non-functional characteristics.</p><p>Despite its importance, non-functionality is neglected compared to functionality, and there is a tendency to ignore it separately and postpone it. This post is written to summarize what perspectives of non-functional requirements are.</p><h3 id="non-functional-requirements" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#non-functional-requirements" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Non-functional requirements</h3><p><strong>Non-functional requirements</strong> are requirements that cover all aspects of functionality.

Changeability</h4><p><strong>Changeability</strong> is the ability of software to be easily improved. Specifically, it means the ability to easily modify/extend/reorganize software, or port it to another platform.</p><p>Software is never used as it was first deployed. Software changes existing requirements and adds new requirements. To respond to user requirements carefully and quickly over a long period of time, an architecture that makes code easy to change is required.</p><p>The <strong>key to a good architecture design for changeability</strong> is to identify <strong>which part of the software has high flexibility for change</strong>, and conversely, where the part that does not change is. Then, the part that needs to have flexibility should increase the flexibility by using patterns that support design considering changes.</p><h5 id="when-using-browser-storage" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#when-using-browser-storage" aria-hidden="true">#</a> When using browser storage</h5><div class="language-javascript line-numbers-mode" data-ext="js"><pre class="language-javascript"><code><span class="token keyword">const</span> <span class="token constant">BROWSER_STORAGE</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> sessionStorage

Interoperability</h4><p><strong>Interoperability</strong> means the ability of software to exchange information with other software. Software requires the ability to connect with each other by exchanging data through the same exchange format, reading and writing files of the same format, or using the same protocol.</p><p>Software is part of a system and does not exist independently. It interacts frequently with other systems or environments. Being able to connect with other software means that existing assets can be utilized as they are.</p><p>In addition, it also reduces the amount of software that needs to be developed from scratch. Therefore, having good <strong>connectivity</strong> means that the software&#39;s range of applications is greatly expanded and leads to <strong>shorter development time</strong> and <strong>significant cost reduction</strong>. In other words, <strong>ease of connection</strong> increases the value of software.</p><h4 id="_3-efficiency" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_3-efficiency" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 3. Efficiency</h4><p><strong>Efficiency</strong> means the ability of software to achieve appropriate performance in terms of <strong>resource usage</strong> while running. Efficiency is divided into <strong>two perspectives</strong>.</p><p><strong>First, time</strong> defines the resource usage efficiency from the perspective of time. It is measured by the <strong>throughput</strong>, which means how many transactions can be completed within a certain time, the <strong>response time</strong>, which is the time it takes from the user&#39;s input operation to the response, and the <strong>turnaround time</strong>, which is the time it takes from the user&#39;s job initiation to the completion of the requested information output.</p><p><strong>Second, computer resources</strong> defines the resource usage efficiency from the perspective of computer resources. It is measured by CPU usage time, memory usage, storage consumption, network transmission, etc.</p><p>To increase <strong>efficiency</strong>, <strong>you need to optimize performance</strong>. Essentially, <strong>static resources</strong> can be optimized using webpack&#39;s tree-shaking and code splitting. Network <strong>speed</strong> can be improved by requesting only the information you need at the moment, or by changing the parts that can be requested in parallel to parallel.</p><div class="language-javascript line-numbers-mode" data-ext="js"><pre class="language-javascript"><code><span class="token comment">// Not Cool</span>

It guarantees proper behavior in the face of exceptions, while also performing internal recovery. As a countermeasure, when a failure occurs, the design should consider limiting the functionality provided and prioritizing the continuity of processing by providing only important functions.</p><p><strong>Second, robustness</strong> is the ability of software to protect itself from <strong>mistakes in usage or input</strong>.

Testability</h4><p><strong>Testability</strong> is the ability to perform effective and efficient testing on software. Effective testing means that the testing is deep and high quality.</p><p>As the size and complexity of software increases, testing becomes more difficult and costly. Therefore, the architecture should not only allow the software to run smoothly, but also make testing easy.</p><p>To design for <strong>testability</strong>, the key is to <strong>remove dependencies between modules</strong>. If there are dependencies, the entire test may be hindered when encountering a difficult part to test.

Software is developed for reuse in other software.</p><p>When <strong>developing software for reuse</strong>, the architecture should be configured to plug into existing structures or modules.
