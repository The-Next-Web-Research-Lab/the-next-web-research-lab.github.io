Lighthouse is an open source web page quality improvement tool released by Google Chrome, and can be easily used in Chrome Developer Tools.</p><p>Lighthouse allows you to select your mobile device.

So no matter how much you adjust the browser size, the mobile screen does not change and always displays the same screen.</p><p>The desktop screen is displayed based on the screen currently being displayed. So, when you adjust the browser size, the desktop screen also changes.</p><h2 id="_2-device-performance" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#_2-device-performance" aria-hidden="true">#</a> 2.

To be exact, the delay time is set to a fixed value of 150ms, the download speed is 1.6Mbps, and the upload speed is 750Kbps.</p><p>The desktop uses the performance of the PC being measured.
