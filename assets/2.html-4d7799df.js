There is only a continuity of decision-making from high-level to low-level.</p><p>Low-level details and high-level structures are all components of the overall software design.</p><p><strong>The goal of software architecture</strong> is to minimize the manpower required to create and maintain the system.</p><p><strong>The measure of design quality</strong> is good design if the cost is low and can be kept low until the end of the system&#39;s life.</p><h3 id="behavior-and-structure" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#behavior-and-structure" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Behavior and structure</h3><ul><li>Behavior: Implementing functional specifications or requirements, and fixing bugs</li><li>Structure: Making it easy and simple to apply changes when you change your mind about functionality</li></ul><p>Focusing on only one of behavior and structure results in short-lived software.</p><h3 id="programming-paradigms" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#programming-paradigms" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Programming paradigms</h3><p>Paradigms tell you what not to do rather than what to do.</p><ul><li>Structured programming: Imposes rules on direct transitions of control flow <ul><li>1968, Edsger W.

ALGOL language</li><li>They discovered that local variables declared in a function could last a long time after the function call returned by moving the function call stack frame to the heap.
