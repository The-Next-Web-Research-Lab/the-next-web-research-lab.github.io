The differences between the two approaches are as follows.</p><h2 id="synthetic-monitoring" tabindex="-1">Synthetic Monitoring <a class="header-anchor" href="#synthetic-monitoring" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Synthetic Monitoring&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Synthetic Monitoring is a method of monitoring performance using automation tools in a consistent environment. It also includes simulating the paths that users can move through the web app and monitoring the performance measured by the simulator.</p><p>Synthetic Monitoring allows you to be aware of performance issues before users detect them, and can be used for benchmarking against competitors.</p><p>Synthetic Monitoring can be measured through <a href="https://webpagetest.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">WebPageTest.org</a>, <a href="https://pagespeed.web.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">PageSpeed Insights</a>.</p><h2 id="real-user-monitoring-rum" tabindex="-1">Real User Monitoring (RUM) <a class="header-anchor" href="#real-user-monitoring-rum" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Real User Monitoring (RUM)&quot;">​</a></h2><p>RUM measures the web app performance of real users. It inserts a script on the page to measure and report the page load data. Unlike Synthetic Monitoring, it measures the actual user&#39;s performance experience without fixing the device, browser, network performance, or geographic location.</p><p>RUM is based on real users, so it needs to receive a large amount of traffic and resources that can handle large data. Therefore, RUM is difficult to build directly, and it is suitable to use a solution. In Korea, there is a solution called <a href="https://imqa.io/mpm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">IMQA MPM</a>, which has impressive articles on the technical blog.</p><h2 id="references" tabindex="-1">References <a class="header-anchor" href="#references" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;References&quot;">​</a></h2><ul><li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/Rum-vs-Synthetic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Performance Monitoring: RUM vs Synthetic Monitoring - Web Performance | MDN</a></li><li><a href="https://newrelic.com/blog/best-practices/synthetic-versus-real-user-monitoring" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Synthetic vs. Real-User Monitoring: How to Improve Your Customer Experience | New Relic</a></li><li><a href="https://sematext.com/blog/real-user-monitoring-vs-synthetic-monitoring/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Synthetic Monitoring vs. Real User Monitoring Comparison - Sematext</a></li><li><a href="https://www.pingdom.com/blog/synthetic-monitoring-vs-real-user-monitoring/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Synthetic Monitoring vs. Real User Monitoring - Pingdom</a></li><li><a href="https://www.catchpoint.com/guide-to-synthetic-monitoring/rum-vs-synthetic-monitoring" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Synthetic &amp; Real User Monitoring Explained - catchpoint</a></li></ul>',11),a=[i];function s(c,h,l,m,g,d){return r(),t("div",null,a)}const u=e(o,[["render",s]]);export{f as __pageData,u as default};
