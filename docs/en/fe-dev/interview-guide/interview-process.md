# Technical Interview Process
In companies where hiring is frequent, the technical interview process is well established, and there are many people involved in hiring, so basic training is also done.

On the other hand, in small companies like startups or SMEs, hiring is done by a small number of people, and there is no process, so new hires may not receive training.

In this post, I will cover the technical interview process and purpose from the interviewer's perspective, and the script from the interviewer's perspective.

## Process and Purpose
### 1. Interview Process Guide
- This is an ice-breaking process for smooth conversation.
- A brief explanation of the interview process is given so that all participants can think of the same context.

### 2. Applicant Self-Introduction
- Most of them are the same as the self-introduction in the resume, so the meaning of listening to the self-introduction itself is low.
- Self-introduction is a process to start questions naturally based on self-introduction.

### 3. Performance Verification
- This is a process of verifying whether the information written on the applicant's resume is actually experienced.
- It is necessary to check if there is any exaggerated history through questions.
- For example, if you say you contributed to open source, but if you look closely, you may have modified a few words in the documentation file.

### 4. Pre-assignment or Technical Verification
- If there is a pre-assignment, proceed with the pre-assignment and then perform technical verification.
- You need to ask specifically why you did this for the pre-assignment and check if you did it yourself.
- In technical verification, basic technical questions such as JavaScript, React, etc. are asked.
- For experienced applicants, questions are also asked from the performance tasks, so the questions are simple.
- For new or intern applicants, the performance tasks are relatively lacking, so the technical questions are also tightly viewed.

### 5. Receive questions from applicants
- Receive questions from applicants about the company.
- This is a process of checking whether the applicant is interested in the company's business or the project to be worked on.
- You can check if the purpose is simply to increase your salary or go to a big company.

## Interviewer Script
When I was an interviewer, I wrote a script to keep the process smooth and the flow uninterrupted.
The following is a script that I actually used.
