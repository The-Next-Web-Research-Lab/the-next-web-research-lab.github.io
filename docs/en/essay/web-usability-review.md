# Service usability review case
When I was a front-end developer of Kakao i Open Builder service,
I summarized the feedback from the design team on the usability improvement after using the service.

## Lack of guidance on features
- Need to provide what/how to create a chatbot at initial access
- Need to make it easy to understand the role/utilization method of basic functions
- Need to indicate upper data when displaying lower data of data with hierarchical relationship
- Need a tooltip that matches the location

## Difficulty in understanding features
- Need to expose the guide area by default as it is activated before the feature is activated
- The same function should have the same wording
- Different functions of different actions should use different icons

## Lack of feedback on user actions
- May feel like an error when there is no feedback even after clicking the button
- Need to give feedback on required/input format first
- The function that notifies the user should be in a position that the user can easily recognize
- When the function connected to the data is disconnected, there should be a wording display that allows the user to recognize the related data

## Difficulty in using features
- Too many actions to add something
- Need a move function for functions that need to move to different routes
- When working in a state where the layer is popped up, the layer should not cover the work area

## Important tasks are too easy
- Data deletion is easy despite being a careful process
