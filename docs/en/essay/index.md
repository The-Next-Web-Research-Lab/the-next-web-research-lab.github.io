# Introduction to Experience Summary
The experience summary contains the knowledge and thoughts that I have experienced in more than 20 projects over 10 years.

When I develop a service, I like to develop something with clear standards. I think it's important to be able to convince yourself why you did what you did, and to set clear standards to explain to your colleagues why you did what you did.

Experience is very important when it comes to being a developer. Anything you have gained knowledge from reading a book or a site is just information. It's better to apply that information to your service or discuss it with your colleagues to create new information and create your own experience. And because experiences are only in the head, they depend on memory, so they can replay false memories.

When I code, I look at the grammar and the behavior and get curious about why it works the way it does. The curiosity stayed in my head and I didn't let go of my thoughts until the clues were solved. So, when I was curious, I put it in writing to quickly escape from my thoughts.

In the experience summary, we talked about thinking about setting standards, valuable experiences, and curiosity.
